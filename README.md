# My-Local-Todolist
This is a Todolist built on NodeJS which equally stores the data (todo) on a cookie session, a local storage which is temporary available until the user closes the browser.

This web app uses a node module *ejs* to display its html page, which can be located at *views/todo.ejs*


**To use this app**

*-1- Clone it*

*-2- run <b>npm install</b>, this will install all dependencies used in the package.json*


<b>How This App Runs</b>

**I've Commented The app.js and views/todo.ejs for better understanding as you read this**

1. First of all, this app runs on port *8080 => (localhost:8080)*...

2. The app.js file is where the server setup is located at, also which route it should point to when the page loads on just *localhost:8080 => localhost:8080/todo*.

3. The app.js also contains functions that handle a couple of buttons clicked in the homepage.
